        ...among other things a musician, a technologist, and a tinkerer. I
        studied computer engineering and music at Case Western Reserve
        University in Cleveland, OH, as well as Music Technology at the Georgia
        Tech Center for Music Technology in Atlanta, GA.

        As a musician I studied saxophone with Greg Banaszak, and have played
        for artists such as Olli-Pekka Tuomisalo, Velvet Brown, Bill Dobbins,
        and George Weremchuck among others. I&apos;ve had the pleasure of
        playing as a soloist and in chamber groups internationally in Germany,
        the Netherlands, and Finland. I directed all-male a cappella ensembles
        for multiple years, arranging dozens of pop and contemporary songs.

        As a technologist I work by day as a software engineer, designing and
        implementing distributed systems providing software experiences for
        connected products. I primarily write in golang and python, but pride
        myself in being as polyglot as possible. I have experience writing
        server, web frontend, desktop frontend, embedded, motor control, and DSP
        code.

        materials, bringing my creations to life with code. My work spaces are
        cluttered with components and computing machines.
